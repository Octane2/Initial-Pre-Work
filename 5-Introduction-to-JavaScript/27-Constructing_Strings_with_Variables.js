/* For this module, I learned how to add a variable value to a string
output. */

// Example
var ourName = "freeCodeCamp";
var ourStr = "Hello, our name is " + ourName + ", how are you?";

// Only change code below this line
var myName = "Steven";
var myStr = "Hello, my name is " + myName + ", how are you?";
