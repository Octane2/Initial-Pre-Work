/* For this module, I learned how to initialize variables that were initially
 defined with no values. */

//My solution for Part 5.

 // Initialize these three variables
var a = 5;
var b = 10;
var c = "I am a";

//----------------------

// Do not change code below this line

a = a + 1;
b = b + 5;
c = c + " String!";
