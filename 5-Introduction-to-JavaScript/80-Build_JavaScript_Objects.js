/* For this module, I learned what a JavaScript object is, and the fact that
they tend to represent real world objects. I also learned that the data contained in an object is
accessed through the properties of the object. */

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  "name": "Poppy",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["Everyone."]
};
