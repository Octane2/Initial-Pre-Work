/* For this module, I learned how to implement a do-while loop in JavaScript.
The syntax is very similar to that of C++.  The do-while loop is ideal for use
with arrays. */

// Setup
var myArray = [];
var i = 10;

// Only change code below this line.

do {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while ( i < 5 );

console.log(myArray);
console.log(i);
