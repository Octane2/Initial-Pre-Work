/* For this module, I learned how to use bracket notation to find
the nth to last character in a string by subracting the number of the
character position from the length of the string. */

// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var thirdToLastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 3];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line
var secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2] ;
