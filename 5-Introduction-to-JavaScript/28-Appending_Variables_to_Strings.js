/* For this module, I learned how to append a variable to a string
using the addition compound operator. */

// Example
var anAdjective = "awesome!";
var ourStr = "freeCodeCamp is ";
ourStr += anAdjective;

// Only change code below this line

var someAdjective = "interesting.";
var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
myStr += someAdjective;
