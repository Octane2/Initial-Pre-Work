/* For this module, I learned that display: flex; allows for the alignment
of children in rows or columns. To set alignment in rows, the property has to
be set to row.  If you want columns, then the property has to be set to column
respectively.  I learned that there are also options for row-reverse and
column reverse.  However, details are lacking in this module, with no
explanation of the behaviors.*/

<style>
  #box-container {
    display: flex;
    height: 500px;

/* My solution for Part 3. */

    flex-direction: row-reverse;
